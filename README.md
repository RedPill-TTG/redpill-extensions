# RedPill Extensions Database

This is a makeshift place to leave information about the extension you've created for the RedPill loader. Please create 
a pull request with a `.txt` file inside of `extensions/` directory. Place it in any of the directories fitting there 
(or create a new one if you think it will fit better). The file should be named exactly like your extension ID and 
should contain a URL to the index file.

For more information see the [developer's docs](https://github.com/RedPill-TTG/redpill-load/docs/extensions-for-devs.md).
